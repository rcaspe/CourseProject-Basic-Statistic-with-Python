# what is statistic
# is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data.

# two main braches of statistic
    # Descriptive statistics
            # common tools of descriptive statistics
                # measures of central tendency
                    # tell us where most values fall, or the typical value of a data set. 
                    # MODE - is the value that shows up the most number of times in a data set.
                    # MEAN, or AVERAGE, is the sum of all the numbers divided by the number of elements
                    # MEDIAN is the middle number of the data set
                        # to get the median, sort the data set first then pick out the middle number
                        # if we have an even number of elements, the median is the average of two terms in the middle.
                        # add the two terms and devide it by 2
                # measure of dispersion or spread
                    # to get a clear picture of how spread out data points are in data set
                        # get the following (Common Measures of Dispersion)
                            # RANGE
                                # is the difference between the high and low values
                                # get the biggest number and subtract the smallest number
                                # get the high value minus the lowest value equals range value
                            # VARIANCE
                                # google the formula (goodluck)
                            # STANDARD DEVIATION
                                # google the formula (goodluck)
                                # NOTE!: if the standard deviation is small, the data values are close to the mean value. If it's high, the data values are widely spread out from the mean value.
            # it describe the sample
    # Inferential statistics
        # uses the sample data to make inferences or conclusions about a larger population
